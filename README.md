# kick-fullstack

Fullstack KickJS workspace — typed end to end.

| Package   | What                                                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server/` | KickJS API (decorators, DI, `kick dev` with typegen watch)       |
| `web/`    | Vite + React, typed against the API via `@forinda/kickjs-client` |

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # server (kick dev) + web (vite), in parallel
```

Server: http://localhost:3000 · Web: http://localhost:5173 (Vite proxies `/api`).

## The type loop

1. Server handlers **return** their payloads (`return this.service.greet(...)`).
2. `kick typegen` emits `server/.kickjs/types/kick__client.d.ts` — the flat
   route map with every response type resolved to a literal shape.
3. `web/tsconfig.json` lists that file in `types`, so `KickClientApi` is
   ambient — no import, no bridge file.
4. `web/src/api.ts`'s `createClient<KickClientApi.Api>` types every call site.

Because the map holds resolved types rather than references to controllers,
`web` never compiles server source: no `experimentalDecorators`, no path
aliases into `server/src`.

Rename a field in `server/src/modules/hello/hello.service.ts` → `web/src/App.tsx`
stops compiling. That's the point.

### Keeping the map fresh

`server/.kickjs/types/kick__client.d.ts` is generated, and `web` reads it as
an ambient type package. Two things follow.

**It is not refreshed by `kick dev`.** Resolving it builds a whole TypeScript
program over the server, which is a build-step cost rather than a per-save one,
so a renamed response field surfaces on the next `kick typegen` rather than on
save. Everything else in `.kickjs/types` still updates on save. Add
`kick typegen --check` to CI and a stale map fails the build.

**It needs a compiler API.** TypeScript 7 ships none, so `server` depends on
`@typescript/typescript6`. Remove it and typegen skips this one file, saying
so; `web` then reports `TS2688` because the file it lists in `types` is gone.

### The other way to wire it

A `types` entry says "this is a global type package", which is what the map is,
and it fails loudly when the file is missing. If you would rather it be quiet
when absent — say, a repo where the map is not always generated — use
`include` instead:

```json
{ "include": ["src", "../server/.kickjs/types/kick__client.d.ts"] }
```

That tolerates the file not existing, at the cost of `KickClientApi` silently
not resolving. Note `types` replaces TypeScript's automatic `@types`
inclusion, so if you add entries there, list the ones you rely on too
(`"types": ["node", "../server/.kickjs/types/kick__client"]`).

Or skip the global entirely — the same file exports the type:

```ts
import type { Api } from '../../server/.kickjs/types/kick__client'

export const api = createClient<Api>({ baseUrl: '/api/v1' })
```
